# ConWeb-Logs
This source is a collection of conversation logs obtained using ConWeb, a browser extension that enables conversational web browsing

This source comprises conversation logs collected during user studies for the voice agent ConWeb. The logs are csv files recording users utterances, corresponding intents, and entities. The two files present in this source refer to two different versions of Conweb. Version ConWeb_v1 used RASA and GPT for the NLU and NLP pipeline. When RASA was not able to classify intents and entities with a precision score, thus in the logs of COnWeb_v1, it is recorded also whether GPT 3 was invoked or not.
ConWeb_v2, instead, uses only GPT 4o for NLP and NLU, thus the table only records utterances, intents and entities.
